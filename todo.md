## world
-[x] render level
    -[x] tile structure barebones
-[x] level generation
    -[x] perlin noise "mountains"
    -[] random walker algorithm?



## player
-[] player data structure
    -[x] barebones
-[x] render player
-[x] move player (mouse click?)
    -[x] player pathfinding
    -[x] Astar pathing for character movement


## game mechanics
-[] player inventory
-[] turn based combat?
    -[] how do we do regular overworld movement & turn based combat?
        -[] does the regular overworld movement need to be turn based as well???
        


### longer term
-[] think about world entities
    -[] tile variety
    -[] art style? ascii vs tilemap? both?
        - [] tile size? 16 x 16 vs 32 x 32?
            - 16 x 16 seems like it might be sufficient... less demanding to create art, less pixels
